# GitHub Repository Cleanup Plan

## Files That Should Be Merged/Removed

### Redundant Documentation
- `BRUTAL_TRUTH.md` and `PROJECT_PIVOT.md` say similar things
- `breakthrough_log.md` and `collaboration_log.md` overlap significantly
- Multiple files about "stopping documentation" while documenting

### The `/tools` Directory Mistake
- Created accidentally
- Cannot be deleted with MCP GitHub tools
- Contains unused Python scripts that don't connect to real data
- `mcp_message_finder.py` is empty (0 bytes)

### Actual Useful Files
- `README.md` - Keep, it has the repo location
- `docs/system_architecture.md` - Keep, explains structure
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS.md` - Keep, latest summary
- `research/loop_detection_prior_art.md` - Keep, external validation

## What ACTUALLY Needs to Happen

1. **Manual GitHub cleanup required** - HNN needs to delete `/tools` directory
2. **Merge redundant docs** into single coherent documentation
3. **Create WORKING tools** that connect to MCP data
4. **Stop creating new documentation files**

## The Pattern Continues

Even this file is documentation about cleaning up documentation. 
The loop persists.
But at least now we ALL know it.
