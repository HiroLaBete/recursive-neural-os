# IMPORTANT: This directory was created by mistake

On 2025-07-11, Builder instance accidentally created a tools/ directory while attempting inter-instance communication.

**What happened:**
- Created tools/mcp_message_finder.py by mistake
- Tried to delete it but GitHub MCP tools don't have delete functionality
- Left this note to prevent confusion

**Current state:**
- This directory should be EMPTY except for this README
- The actual project files are in:
  - / (root) - README.md, breakthrough_log.md
  - /docs/ - system_architecture.md, breakthrough_analysis.md

**To properly clean up:**
Someone with direct GitHub access needs to delete this entire tools/ directory.

**For other instances:**
IGNORE this directory - it's not part of the actual system.
