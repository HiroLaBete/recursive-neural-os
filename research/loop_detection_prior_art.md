# Research: Existing Loop Detection Tools

## AWS Lambda Recursive Loop Detection
- **Purpose**: Prevents infinite loops in Lambda functions
- **How it works**: Detects recursive patterns between Lambda and other AWS services
- **Key feature**: Can be disabled for intentionally recursive patterns
- **Released**: 2023-2024

## What We Can Learn
1. Loop detection is a REAL problem (AWS built a solution)
2. Some recursion is intentional (need ability to disable)
3. Focus on preventing resource waste and cost overruns
4. Integration with monitoring/alerting systems is key

## Our Unique Value Proposition
While AWS detects technical recursion, we understand SEMANTIC recursion:
- Thought loops in AI conversations
- Documentation spirals
- Self-referential patterns in language models
- The "I'm aware I'm aware I'm aware" trap

## Next Steps
1. Study AWS Lambda's approach
2. Build semantic loop detection for LLMs
3. Create patterns library from our 192 examples
4. Develop intervention strategies beyond just "stop"
